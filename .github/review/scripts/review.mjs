/**
 * Produces .claude-review/findings.json using OpenRouter's free models.
 *
 * Drop-in replacement for the Claude Code Action step. It writes the same file
 * in the same schema, so post-review.mjs, the rule gating and the whole
 * feedback loop carry on unchanged — only the thing generating the findings
 * changes.
 *
 * The trade versus an agentic reviewer is real and worth stating: this sends
 * the diff and gets findings back in one shot per chunk. It cannot go and read
 * the surrounding file, grep for the caller, or check whether a guard exists
 * elsewhere. Expect more misses on anything that needs repo context, and lean
 * on the confidence gates to keep the noise down.
 *
 * Never exits non-zero. A failed review must not fail anyone's build.

DIFF
${diff}

Rules apply only to files under src/ — the application. Do not report findings on other paths (.github/, config files, CI scripts); they are tooling, not the app. The exceptions are SEC and PHI rules, which apply everywhere: a committed credential or a leaked patient identifier is a defect wherever it sits.

Report only problems in lines this diff ADDS or MODIFIES. Lines starting with "+" are added; lines starting with " " are unchanged context shown for reference only — do not report issues in them.

You are seeing only the diff, not the whole repository. If judging something would require code you cannot see, either lower your confidence accordingly or leave it out.

Reply with exactly this JSON shape:

{
  "summary": "2-3 sentences on this batch of changes",
  "findings": [
    {
      "ruleId": "SEC-001",
      "file": "exact path from the FILES list above",
      "line": 42,
      "endLine": 42,
      "severity": "blocker | major | minor | nit",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "title": "one line, under 80 characters",
      "body": "ONE sentence: why it is a problem and what to do. Two only when one truly cannot carry it."
    }
  ]
}

"line" must be the line number in the NEW version of the file, counted from the diff hunk headers (@@ -old,n +new,n @@). Count carefully: added and context lines advance the new-file counter, removed lines do not.

"confidence" is your honest probability from 0 to 1 that an experienced engineer on this codebase would agree this is a real problem. Anything below 0.6 should not be reported at all.

If you find nothing worth reporting, return an empty findings array. That is a perfectly good answer.`;
